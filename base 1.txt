Thanks for your patience — I need to pause the Base64 approach right here to avoid corrupting your file.

⚠️ Important (Transparent Explanation)

The earlier Base64 parts (Part 1 and Part 2) were sent from different document states and won’t decode into a valid Word file together. If we continue with Part 3, the final file would fail to open or be corrupted.

So instead of risking broken output, here is the 100% reliable solution that works in every locked-down environment:

TECHNICAL DESIGN DOCUMENT (TDD)

Turbo – Network Change Backup & Intelligent Diff Automation


---

1. Document Control

Field	Value

Document Title	Turbo Network Change Backup Automation – Technical Design
Version	1.0
Author	Turbo Engineering
Date	2025
Status	Draft
Reviewed By	TBD



---

2. Purpose

This document describes the technical design and implementation approach for the Turbo Network Change Backup & Intelligent Diff Automation module.

The solution enables:

Bulk pre-change and post-change backups

Data capture via SSH and vendor APIs

Semantic network-aware comparison

Audit-ready reporting

Rollback intelligence



---

3. Scope

In Scope

Multi-vendor backup automation

Cisco Meraki API integration

Palo Alto PAN-OS API integration

F5 BIG-IP iControl REST integration

SSH-based CLI backups

Semantic network diff engine

Reporting and rollback


Out of Scope

Configuration deployment

Change approvals

CMDB ownership

5. Component Design


---

5.1 Turbo UI

Input:

Change Ticket ID

Device IP list (manual / CSV)

Device types

Command profiles

Backup mode (PRE / POST / BOTH)


Output:

Backup status

Semantic diff summary

Risk flags

Report downloads




---

5.2 API Layer

Authentication (JWT / SSO)

Request validation

Job submission

Job status polling

Result retrieval



---

5.3 Orchestrator

Parallel execution

Device fan-out

Retry logic

Timeout control

Failure aggregation


States:

Queued

Running

Completed

Partial Failure

Failed



---

5.4 Vendor Adapters

Adapter	Method

Meraki	REST API
Palo Alto	XML + REST API
F5 BIG-IP	iControl REST
Generic Devices	SSH CLI



---

5.5 Backup Repository

/<TicketID>/
   /PRE/
   /POST/
   /DIFF/

Storage Options:

Local filesystem

NAS

SFTP

Git



---

5.6 Semantic Diff Engine

Transforms raw configurations into structured objects:

Object	Intelligence

VLANs	Added / Removed / Orphaned
Interfaces	Admin, Oper, Trunk, Access
ACLs	Permit/Deny changes
Routes	Next-hop modifications
F5 VS	Pool & monitor changes


Outputs:

Engineering summary

Machine JSON diff

Raw text diff



---

6. Workflow Execution


---

6.1 Pre-Change Phase

1. Engineer submits change


2. Turbo validates:

IP reachability

Credentials



3. Parallel backups collected


4. Stored as:



<Device>_PRE_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt


---

6.2 Change Implementation

Engineer performs change manually

Turbo waits for POST trigger



---

6.3 Post-Change Phase

Same backup process

Files saved as:


<Device>_POST_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt


---

6.4 Diff & Reporting Phase

PRE vs POST comparison

Semantic intelligence generated

Risk scoring applied

Final reports produced



---

7. Data Models

7.1 Device Model

device_id
ip_address
vendor
device_type

7.2 Backup Metadata

ticket_id
device_id
snapshot_type
timestamp

7.3 Diff Output

vlans_added
interfaces_modified
acls_changed
risk_level


---

8. Security Design

Encrypted credential vault

Token-based API access

Read-only audit backups

SIEM-integrated logging



---

9. Error Handling

Failure	Action

PRE backup failure	Block change
POST failure	Partial risk
Security ACL change	High risk
Interface down	Rollback advisory



---

10. Performance & Scalability

500+ devices per job

Parallel execution

API rate-limit handling

3-retry policy



---

11. Audit & Compliance

Immutable backups

SHA-256 integrity hashing

Full job execution history

Tamper-proof diff reports



---

12. Rollback Design

PRE backups as rollback baselines

Delta-based reverse commands

Engineer-triggered rollback support



---

13. Conclusion

Turbo provides a vendor-agnostic, intelligent, audit-ready network change assurance platform that significantly improves operational safety and compliance.


---
