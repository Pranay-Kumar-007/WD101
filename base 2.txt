1. Document Control

Field	Value

Document Title	Turbo Network Change Backup Automation – Technical Design
Version	1.0
Author	Turbo Engineering
Date	2025
Status	Draft



---

2. Purpose

This document describes the technical design and implementation approach for the Turbo Network Change Backup & Intelligent Diff Automation module.
The system enables engineers to:

Perform bulk pre- and post-change backups

Capture data using SSH and vendor APIs

Perform network-aware semantic diffing

Generate engineering-readable change summaries

Support rollback and audit requirements



---

3. Scope

This design covers:

✅ Multi-vendor backup automation
✅ Cisco Meraki, Palo Alto, F5 API integration
✅ SSH-based device backup
✅ Semantic network diff engine
✅ Change reporting and rollback support

Out of Scope:

Actual device configuration deployment

Change approval workflows

CMDB design (integration only)

5. Component Design

5.1 Turbo UI

Accepts:

Change Ticket ID

IP address list (manual / CSV / Excel)

Device type selection

Backup mode: PRE / POST / BOTH

Command profiles


Displays:

Backup status (success/failure)

Semantic diff summary

Raw pre/post output

Risk indicators




---

5.2 API Layer

Function	Description

Authentication	JWT / SSO
Input Validation	IP format, vendor mapping
Job Submission	Creates workflow job
Status API	Polling job state
Result API	Fetch PRE/POST + diff reports



---

5.3 Orchestrator

Responsible for:

Parallel device execution

Retry handling

Timeout management

Failure aggregation


States:

QUEUED

RUNNING

PARTIAL_FAIL

COMPLETED

FAILED




---

5.4 Vendor Adapters

Meraki Adapter

Uses REST Dashboard API

Fetches:

Devices

VLANs

Switch ports

Interface assignments



Palo Alto Adapter

Uses:

XML API for full config

REST API for security policies


Fetches:

Running config

Interfaces

Routing

Security rules



F5 Adapter

Uses iControl REST

Fetches:

Virtual servers

Pools

VLANs

Self IPs



SSH Adapter

Executes:

show running-config

show vlan

show ip route

show interface status

show access-lists




---

5.5 Backup Repository

Storage Pattern

/<Ticket_ID>/
   /PRE/
     Device_Vendor_Timestamp.txt
   /POST/
     Device_Vendor_Timestamp.txt
   /DIFF/
     Device_Diff.json

Supported Storage:

Local filesystem

NFS / NAS

SFTP

Git repository (optional)



---

5.6 Semantic Diff Engine

Instead of raw text diff, configs are parsed into structured network objects.

Object Type	Intelligence

VLAN	Added / Removed / Orphaned
Interface	Admin / Oper / VLAN / Trunk
ACL	Permit/Deny / Order Change
Route	Next-hop change
F5 VS	Pool member changes


Output Types

JSON diff

Engineering summary

Raw text diff



---

6. End-to-End Workflow Execution


---

6.1 Pre-Change Phase

1. Engineer submits change


2. Turbo validates:

IP reachability

Credentials



3. Devices executed in parallel


4. Snapshots labeled as:



Device_PRE_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt


---

6.2 Change Execution (External)

Turbo pauses

Engineer applies change

Turbo waits for POST trigger



---

6.3 Post-Change Phase

Same execution logic as PRE

Files labeled:


Device_POST_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt


---

6.4 Diff & Reporting Phase

PRE vs POST mapped

Semantic analysis performed

Risk engine triggered

Reports generated



---

7. Data Models


---

7.1 Device Inventory

{
  "device_id": "SW-01",
  "ip": "10.10.10.1",
  "vendor": "Cisco",
  "type": "Switch"
}


---

7.2 Backup Metadata

{
  "ticket": "CHG12345",
  "device_id": "SW-01",
  "snapshot": "PRE",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-28T10:25:44Z"
}


---

7.3 Diff Output

{
  "vlans_added": [120, 121],
  "interfaces_changed": ["Gi1/0/2"],
  "acls_modified": ["INTERNET-IN"],
  "risk_level": "HIGH"
}


---

8. Security Design

Area	Control

Credentials	Vault encrypted
API Access	Token-based
File Storage	Read-only audit access
Logs	SIEM integration



---

9. Error Handling & Recovery

Failure Type	Action

PRE backup fails	Block change
Partial POST fail	Mark device at risk
Unexpected ACL deny	Auto high-risk flag
Interface down	Recommend rollback



---

10. Performance & Scalability

Metric	Target

Devices per job	500+
API rate control	Token bucket
Parallel threads	Configurable
Retry attempts	3



---

11. Audit & Compliance

Immutable snapshot retention

SHA256 file hashing

Full execution logs

Tamper-proof diff reports



---

12. Rollback Design

PRE snapshot used as rollback template

Delta-based reverse commands generated

Engineer-triggered rollback execution



---

✅ Conclusion

This technical design enables Turbo to function as a fully automated, vendor-agnostic, network-intelligent change assurance system that:

Eliminates blind change execution

Provides engineering-level intelligence

Reduces outage risk

Meets audit and compliance standards



---

✅ What Would You Like Me To Add Next?

I can now add:

✅ Sequence Diagram
